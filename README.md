# ScreenRecorder.js
A minimal Screenrecorder based on the MediaStream API

## Requirements

A modern browser, preferably Chrome or Edge.
Take this as an Guideline:

[MediaDevices.getDisplayMedia() Browser Compability on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia#browser_compatibility)


## Usage

Pretty straightforward, either host it on a webserver, both files on the same path, and open it in your Browser.
If you dont have a webserver at hand, put both files in a local dir and then open ```index.html``` in your Browser.

After that Usage is pretty straightforward, considering there are only three buttons. :)
